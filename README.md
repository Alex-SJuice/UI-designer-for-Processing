# UI-designer-for-Processing
 an expandible system for designing and using GUI in Processing projects. it's VERY much a WIP and it is very bare bones currently. If you have any suggestions on hat to add, please tell me
\nthe controls for the designer are as follows:
#b for button placing
s for slider placing
t for text display placing
backspace for selection mode (interact with the ui you've placed)
once your in a placing mode, drag and drop to create a new ui element
for all three, first type in a color in hexadecimal with NO hashtag
to input a color or label or any kind of text, just type it out and then press enter or backspace to delete the previous character simple stuff
for buttons, input a second color
then for all three, input the label for the ui element
to delete a ui element that is already present, put your mouse over it and press delete
to save your ui, press tab, this will save your ui to a text file that you specify in the program itself
also, you need to give the program a valid path to a font in order to work
